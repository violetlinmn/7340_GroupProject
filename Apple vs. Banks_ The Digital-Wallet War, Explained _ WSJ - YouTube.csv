"Well, banks didn't roll out contactless cards to compete with Apple Pay, in Europe contactless cards and other digital wallets have existed since 2008 way before Apple Pay, starting with Mastercard PayPass and Visa PayWave. Maybe not in the U.S. but contactless technology was designed to be used with physical cards, then banks started launching their own virtual cards using the NFC capabilities of Android Phones, later Apple gatekeeped NFC to be used only with the Wallet app, forcing banks to pay the fee, creating Apple Pay.",,https://www.youtube.com/@Kewtopia,"

"I was living in England for a few years and contactless payment was the norm. At restaurants they even brought card scanners to your table. My card would never leave my sight. After coming back to the US I realized how backwards it is when it comes to this technology. In the US, where the server  takes your card to the back  to scan your card (and with malicious intent write down your card information).

"One thing you're missing is the fact that banks do not keep the whole interchange fee either. They have to give a portion of it to whichever processing network the transaction was done over. This means that Visa and Mastercard, with their networks, take a fee when it is processed through them. Therefore, they actually only keep ~5-8 cents on a transaction. Then, you add on the fees that Apple and others could take... That is why they're scared.",https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_nv_E-1_ZuypHOeW2kaQjuuF9id6JpqecbXfUb01VAd7w=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,https://www.youtube.com/@perryawe2121,"

When they announced it at WWDC 2014 I was sure it was going to be a game-changer that was going to succeed specifically since it is built directly into the iPhone. But my goodness, did the pandemic in 2020 really make this thing suddenly take off, with consumers being afraid to increase physical contact by swapping cards between people. 

I believe we're now in a era where Apple Pay is too big to fail, since 2020 showed people how quick in effortless it is to just which out your phone and hover it over a display for 2 seconds in comparison to digging into you pocket or purse, finding your card, pulling it out, entering it into the terminal, and doing everything in reverse once completed.",https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_nLmppRmdeNoMVMDeE4MQm1u_PruVWx6i09JiBEadA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,https://www.youtube.com/@javianjohnson8746,"

"It's weird seeing this because here in Finland, we had NFC cards for several years before any mobile payment stuff. Then Nordea actually had their own payment app available years before Apple and Google, but it was limited to Android only thanks to Apple not allowing NFC to be used by apps. After Apple and Google got their systems here, they shut down their own app and just allowed using Apple and Google as othervice they would lose their business with people using iPhone. 

So this goes back around to notion that Apple basically needs to be stopped. What's the reason to disallow using NFC on the phone by apps other than to reduce competition? They have made iPhone such ecosystem that they are forcing everyone, including other companies and non-apple users, to bend over as well.

"I find it strange that payment processing is managed by private companies. Transactions should facilitate commerce---not be subject to it. Companies impose merchant fees and vendor lock-in. Not only that, but the technology already exists which makes these companies entirely redundant (distributed ledgers). This video is excellent, but it discusses an outdated commerce framework which needs to be obsolesced. Distributed ledger technology provides self-sovereign identities, advanced security, privacy, democracy, resiliency, and affordability, among others, all of which traditional banks and companies have been shown to 1, fail at in practice (they own your account, have been hacked, experience outages, bank runs, track your purchases, and charge fees), and 2: fail at in theory (they are subject to regulatory influence and social engineering and many attack vectors, and only possess financial motivation), all of which are not true for DLTs. The people using crypto are getting by just fine and they are actively contributing to a better system, but it's difficult when merchants don't accept it and people resist its legitimacy or don't care for positive change.


Another step would also be to democratize the underlying internetworking infrastructure as well, which provides many of the same benefits as DLTs do, and which ISPs experience many of the same drawbacks, and again for which technology already exists (mesh networks, CJDNS). And fore each, even if the technology didn't exist, the theory does, and is worth our investment.",,https://www.youtube.com/@oattygengar9586,"

They took the cash and the cards and went straight to local Target trying to buy thousands in Gift Cards. This made me realize I also was carrying a bunch of cards I never used like Debit Cards just for the ATM, etc. Apple Pay allowed me to reduce everything down to a ""light physical wallet"" where I carry 1 CC, my license and maybe $40 all locked in my glove box.

American banks follow suite with the saying “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it”. Banks need to get with the times and figure out how to work with Apple. Millions of people already use apple phones so it makes sense for apple to have everything on one device. This new payment system that banks are trying called Paze just sounds stupid. Market better and choose a better name. I already don’t want to use Paze because that doesn’t sound appealing. Apple Pay just sounds more trusting and advanced. I already know there are some passionate android users that will say otherwise but I don’t care. Apple will always be an innovator and pushing the boundaries of what technology can do.,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_myNHwNyWgdfQYSSJB2Jy6izHxzrEZelG5X1pZvApPWJ-s=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,https://www.youtube.com/@MrBuildboy,"

"The odd thing - Google Pay (Google Wallet) was actually first - 2011 vs Apple Pay in 2014. But Google didn't really market it well and didn't go after banks to participate (they still don't - a lot of banks don't work with Google Pay). They also limited their early offerings to the US where chip card and card tap and pay was virtually unknown. The rest of the world jumped on chip and pin and tap and pay FAR faster than the US did and so there's much more competition on those services outside the US, especially in India and China.
Biggest surprise, Apple Pay is NOT the most widely used phone tap&pay system. AliPay and WeChat Pay are.",,https://www.youtube.com/@TheoWerewolf,"

"Horrid. I have my visa debit and my EC cards and purchases cost nothing, equally as much as the cashier at a till doesn't demand 1 Euro and 10 cents for an item I am paying for costing 1 Euro. This is just cost being incurred and inconvenience created for the consumer. No wonder they want to get of cash. These new payment methods simply make no sense at all other than to artificially produce a charge for something unnecessary so that others suddenly start to make money from you providing you with absolutely NOTHING other than you having to pay for something that in the past you didn't have to. And the American modus operandi is always implement something for so long that in the end people think it's normal.
